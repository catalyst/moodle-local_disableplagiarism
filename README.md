# Disable plagiarism #
This plugin was developed thanks to funding from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn)

When viewing large numbers of assignments on the grading page, this can impact on the page loading time. 
This plugin adds a button at the top of the assignment grading page "Hide/Show plagiarism links" allowing the teacher to hide/show the plagiarism links.
The decision to hide/show the links is stored as a user-preference which applies to the grading page for all assignments on the site.
